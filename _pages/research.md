Most studies focus on the construction of new transportation infrastructure in developing nations. In this paper, we analyze the maintenance of existing roads in the U.S. which avoids issues of endogeneity coming from the placement of new roads. We design a quasi-experiment to study local referendums introduced to renew road maintenance taxes, which are typically levied via property taxes. We compare housing sale prices between similar areas that narrowly pass or fail road tax levies and use satellite images to fine-tune an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model for classifying road quality. Our results show that local jurisdictions with close elections that decide to cut road taxes face an average loss of $163,547 (11%) in road maintenance funds, experience a 23% decline in road quality, and suffer a $15,350 (9%) drop in house prices over the course of 10 years relative to similar areas that renew funding. Heterogeneity analysis reveals a stronger percentage decline in urban areas and for expensive houses relative to rural areas and cheaper houses, along with evidence for dosage-response for larger tax cuts.

We examine whether reinvestment in single-family homes (SFHs) varies by housing tenure and by landlord size. Using micro-level parcel data from Minneapolis (2017–2024) and Charlotte (2004–2023), we link annual tax assessor records with publicly available building permit data to measure reinvestment. Rental properties are identified via homestead exemptions and mailing addresses, and large landlords are defined based on property-ownership thresholds. In Minneapolis, SFHs for renters file 22% less building permits and invest 33% less in permitted work than otherwise comparable owner-occupied units. In Charlotte, single-family rentals file 9% fewer permits and invest 1–2% less in dollar terms. Moreover, homes owned by large landlords in both cities file 26–56% fewer permits and invest 6–34% less than smaller landlords. Further, we find no statistical difference in plumbing permits, suggesting that landlords and large owners will forego proactive reinvestment, but not primarily reactive repair activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that the growing prevalence of rental occupancy and large-landlord ownership in the SFH market may lead to diminished reinvestment over time, thus increasing depreciation of the overall single-family housing stock.

    We collect micro-level sentiment data on standardized testing for college admissions from undergraduate students and faculty at an R1 institution in the United States. Our findings reveal a notable disparity: students place 23% less weight on standardized tests in the admissions process compared to faculty. Furthermore, in contrast to students’ perceptions, faculty opinions align with Chetty et al. (2023) as they view the standardized tests as a reliable predictor of both academic performance and post-college success.
